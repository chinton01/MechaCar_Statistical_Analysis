## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Vehicle_length and ground clearance provided no-random amount of variance to mpg in the dataset.
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- The slope is not zero because it's value is smaller the 0.05.
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- The linear model is adequate for predicting the of MechaCar protypes effectively. The multiple R-squared value is around 70%, which is a very decent value for predicting mpg
